# PLDM State sensors

This page is work in progress, aggregating all the information we have so far with all the proposals.
We are iterating on this with pull requests until reaching final state.
Once finilized, we are taking this proposal to DMTF PLDM cometee.

For each state we want to define a "state result", which basically explains what we can expect after each state is done, I will take it internally and come with a proposal but feel free to do the same.

Each vendor should go over the list, see how it fits into his current flow and if there are new states which are needed or states that are unnecessary.

On top of the states we want to try and create a document in PLDM describing "how should a xPU be managed with PLDM".
